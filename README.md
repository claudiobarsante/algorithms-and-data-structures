### Algorithms and Data Structures

---

- 🤓 I'm sharing some exercises with my solutions using javascript that I hope to be helpful to anyone that it's studying algorithms and data structures. Be free to contribute.

If you need an extension to run the code on VSCode you could use <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner'> code-runner </a>

The solutions and exercises are divided into the following folders

## 🗂

- 📁 Codility
- 📁 Leetcode
- 📁 HackerRank

## 🏆

On 06/31/2021 I received my first gold badge from HackerRank
