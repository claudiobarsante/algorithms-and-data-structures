/*
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
 

Follow up: Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

   Hide Hint #1  
The entire logic for reversing a string is based on using the opposite directional two-pointer approach!
*/

/**
 * @param {character[]} s
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
var reverseString = function (s) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = s.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    const temp = s[left];
    s[left] = s[right];
    s[right] = temp;
    left++;
    right--;
  }
};

console.log(reverseString(['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']));
